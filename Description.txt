The iterative matrix multiplication method has been implemented. I was unable to apply it using Strassen's algorithm due to 
shortage of time. 

I have developed the iterative method as MatMul.java. I have also written a unit test for it, though it is failing and I wasn't
able to find out why. The test can be found in Lab1/MatMul/test/matmul/MatMulTest.java.

I have also made a .jar library of the project which can be found in Lab1/MatMul/dist/MatMul.jar.

In the MatMul.java file. There are two methods. The Multiplication method takes two matrices as arguments and multiplies them
iteratively. The displayAnswer method is the method which displays the answer matrix in matrix form. It takes one matrix (2-d 
array) as an argument. Finally, in the main function, two matrices are hard-coded and then both these functions are applied on
these two hard-coded matrices to display the final answer on the screen.
